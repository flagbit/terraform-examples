# Terraform configuration examples for gridscale

This repository contains configuration files you can use as a starting point for [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) on gridscale. We also have some step-by-step guides on how to use these config files in our [tutorials](https://gridscale.io/en/community/tutorials/terraform-ubuntu-einrichten-gridscale/) section. Check them out!

To use the config files, you'll need an [API token](https://my.gridscale.io/Easy/APIs/) and a [gridscale](https://my.gridscale.io/signup/) account.

After Terraform is up and running, you can navigate to one of the example directories and run `terraform init` and `terraform apply`. You will be prompted to enter your API credentials by Terraform.

Have fun!
